# Catalog of my things

> In this project, we created a console app that helps you keeping
a record of different types of things you won: books, music albums, movies,
and games. Everything will be based on the UML class diagram presented below.
The data will be stored in JSON files but we also prepared a database with
tables structure analogical to your program's class structure.


## Built With

- Ruby
- Rspec, Rspec utils
- Git, Gitflow

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Ruby

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Leboroz/catalog-of-my-things.git

$ cd catalog-of-my-things
```
### Install

- run
```bash
$ bundle install
```

> this will install all the packages necessaries to run the app and tests

### Usage
- run
```bash
$ ruby main.rb
```

The console app, at the start, should:
- Present the user with a list of options to perform.
- Let users choose an option.
- If needed, ask for parameters for the option.
